            <h4>Sir Lewis Hamilton: The knight is unemployed in F1 as Mercedes’ parents Daimler refuse lofty demands</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2021/01/fed97865-black-and-red-gaming-youtube-channel-art-2020-12-18t005724.088.jpg">
            <p>Sir Lewis Hamilton could be without a team this season in F1 if he doesn’t reach a compromise with
                Mercedes. As things stand, he is a free agent, but with only one seat available in the grid, – as
                Valtteri Bottas’ partner in Mercedes – things could turn upside down for him.</p>

            <p>According to the Italian wing of Motorsport.com, Hamilton has rejected the proposal by Daimler, Mercedes’
                parents, and 1/3rd owner of the F1 team. It remains to be known what Hamilton’s counteroffer is, and his
                contingency plan, given McLaren won’t shock the world by bringing him in for either Lando Norris or
                Daniel Ricciardo.</p>

                <p class="citation">“From my point of view, We've had such a successful run of championships in the past seven years
                    that there is no reason to continue. He's on the top of his game and he will be for a while.
                    And that's why continuing together is a no-brainer”</p>

            <p>Daimler’s board of directors is reportedly unhappy with the reigning demands. Considering the fact that
                the automobile industry suffered a rude shock last year due to the Kovid-19, it all makes sense to
                reject Hamilton’s proposal.</p>

                    <p>Barcelona are unbeaten in eight matches after an emphatic victory over Granada moved them up to
                        third in LaLiga.</p>
                    <p>Antoine Griezmann and Lionel Messi combined to devastating effect as Barcelona thumped Granada
                        4-0 to claim their fourth consecutive away LaLiga win.</p>

                    <p>Ronald Koeman's team continued their recent revival as Messi scored twice for the second straight
                        game, with Barca taking a three-goal lead into half-time.</p>

                        <p>Griezmann also netted a double and assisted one of Messi's strikes in one of his finest showings
                        in a Barca shirt after what has been a difficult spell since joining from Atletico Madrid in
                        2019.</p>

                        <p>The victory moves Barca up to third and within four points of Atletico and two of rivals Real
                        Madrid, who are at Osasuna later on Saturday. </p>

                            <p>Son Heung-min and Harry Kane are doing "special things" for Tottenham this season, Jose
                                Mourinho said after they inspired Spurs to a 3-0 Premier League win over Leeds United.

                            <p>Tottenham ended a run of four games without a win in the Premier League in comfortable
                                fashion on Saturday, Son reaching a landmark in the process</p>
                            <p>After Kane's penalty put Spurs ahead, Son doubled their advantage with his 100th goal for
                                the club, the England international unsurprisingly the provider.</p>

                    <p>“It’s not easy being my team mate, you know?” – Lewis Hamilton's kind words for his Mercedes team
                        mate Valtteri Bottas, who he has praised as being one of the most mentally resilient drivers in
                        Formula 1.</p>
